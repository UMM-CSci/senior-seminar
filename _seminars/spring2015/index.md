The CSci discipline invites you to Spring 2015 Senior Seminar conference on Saturday, April 25 2015. The talks will be held 12:30-3:40pm in Sci 1020. Refreshments will be served. 

Many thanks to those who provided feedback for this semesters' students: Jim Hall and the alumni reviewers Stephen Adams, Lucas Ellgren, Justin Mullin, David Ruprecht, Tim Snyder, and Scott Steffes.

Papers and presentations that were evaluated as deserving a distinction are marked with ðŸŒŸ (this will be done after the conference).
