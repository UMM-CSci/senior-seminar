## About the conference

Senior Seminar conference follows a standard CSci conference format. Each seminar participant presents their paper to the audience
of peers, faculty, and guests (family, friends, and alums). Presentations summarize the papers, focusing on the key points, 
and often omitting some level of details. Presentations are targeted towards CSci students who finished Data Structures. 
Each presentation concludes by a brief question-and-answer period.

Senior Seminar conference includes all student presentations as a one-day event (we have occasionally held it on Thursday/Friday,
evenings, but we try to make it Saturday if at all possible). Talks are scheduled at half-an-hour intervals 
(roughly 25 minutes per talk, including questions, and 5 minutes for people to stretch their legs and for the next speaker 
to set up). We usually have half an hour break after the first two hours of talks. Refreshments and snacks are served.

In order to get a passing grade you must attend the entire conference.

This is a somewhat formal event. The expectation is that presenters wear [Business Casual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_casual) 
style clothes. Jeans (even in the style described on the wikipedia page) are discouraged. Start thinking about your attire early on so
that if you don't have appropriate clothing on campus, you have time to have it sent from home or buy it.

Family and friends are welcome to attend the conference. The Csci discipline provides snacks (crackers, cheese, fruit) and pop. 
The building is handicap-accessible. Please let us know if you or your guests need any accommodations or have any dietary 
restrictions.

There is usually an informal gathering in the evening after the conference for students, their friends and family,
and faculty to celebrate students' accomplishments and just to hang out.

## Date and time

Senior Seminar conference is usually held on Saturday before the last week of the semester, starting early afternoon (about 1pm).
