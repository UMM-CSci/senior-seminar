# Gold Star Distinction &#x2B50;

As you know, senior seminar is graded pass/fail. However, starting Fall 2011 we note excellent papers and presentations as "passed with distinction". Those would be marked with a "gold star" (&#x2B50;) on the website and be recommended to future students as examples of what we are looking for. If you receive a distinction on your paper or presentation, make sure to note it on your resume. Congratulations to those who received this distinction!

See each semester's papers and talks [here](https://umm-csci.github.io/senior-seminar/seminars/) for gold star papers and presentation slide decks.
