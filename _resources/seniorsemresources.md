## Finding research papers

People find most of their resources from these sources, both available through Briggs Library:

- ACM Digital Library
- IEEE Xplore 

These are large libraries of research papers, many available as full text PDFs. 
Many Senior Sem students do their entire projects using papers they find from these libraries.

To get to these resources:

- You must be logged in to the university system (your email, OneStop, etc). The university provides these resources free of charge to its students and employees, upon login.
- Go to Library page, choose Resources, and within it choose Article and Reference Databases.
- Find "ACM Digital Library" and "IEEE Xplore" in the list.
- Within these resources you can search by keywords, but, unless you know exactly what topic you are looking for, I would recommend first to browse recent journals and conferences (see proceedings) for areas that interest you, to get a general sense for how "well-published" a certain topic is. 

[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) is an excellent search tool, and can often (but by no means always) hook you up with a full text copy.
It also allows you to push forward in time by clicking on the "Cited by" links. 
This is really valuable if you find an older article that's really interesting, 
and want to find more recent articles that build on that work.

[CiteSeer](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/index;jsessionid=F91CFD565EC02ED261F4D1608F5AE395) used to be a really useful tool, especially for pushing forward through citations. 
I (Nic) find it much less useful these days than Google Scholar, as Scholar seems to be a much more useful search tool. 
That said, CiteSeer still has an excellent cache of full text copies of papers and is valuable for that. 
If CiteSeer's search tools are making you crazy, you might try using Google to search their site 
(add site:citeseerx.ist.psu.edu to your query).

People should feel free to help extend this. Other sources? What sources of papers worked best for you?

[Meet Science: What is "peer review"?](http://boingboing.net/2011/04/22/meet-science-what-is.html)is a nice piece on what peer review is (and isn't).

## Sample annotated bibliography

You can keep your annotated bibliography in a notebook or a text file on your computer,
or you can use things like web-based bookmarking tools. 
[This example shows](http://del.icio.us/bvisto) how a student used a bookmarking site to store and annotate his bibliography entries.

## Writing

["How to get your article rejected" by Martin Hagger](https://www.chapman.edu/wilkinson/_files/crassh/how%20to%20get%20your%20article%20rejected.pdf) is a nice article humorously outlining a number of common
(but often fatal) problems in writing up research papers.

## LaTeX and formatting

We use a slightly modified version of the ACM sig-alternate document class for our proceedings formatting.
You can [get this from Github](https://github.com/UMM-CSci/Senior_seminar_templates) along with example files/projects that illustrate the creation of annotated bibliographies
and the creation of senior seminar papers for the proceedings. We'd recommend simply [forking that project](https://github.com/UMM-CSci/Senior_seminar_templates/fork) as that will give you 
copies of all those files, a nice version control system for managing changes to your senior seminar work, 
the ability to pull down changes we make to the master project, and the ability to issue pull requests on fixes or changes you
make that you think would be of value to other students.
