# Finding appropriate sources

Your paper will be based on recent peer reviewed computer science research literature. We require you to have at least three reasonably recent peer reviewed sources as key sources of your paper. 

It is essential that you use sources that inform you about the topic of your paper in a way that you can understand and summarize in your paper and your presentation. The topic of your paper is ultimately determined by your sources. If the source papers that you are trying to use are too complex or not detailed enough or poorly written, writing your own paper based on these sources would be very challenging and may be frustrating. Thus, choosing good sources at an appropriate level is one of the keys to writing a good senior seminar paper. 

## Finding sources

*Peer reviewed* computer science literature means papers that were published in computer science journals or proceedings of computer science conferences or workshops where publications are selected based on reviews by experts in the field.

### How to find peer reviewed sources

Most senior seminar students start with some idea of what their topics of interest are. However, this idea may be vague, or it you may be choosing between several different areas of interest, or you may not know if a topic you are interested in is appropriate for senior seminar. That's ok. In the first 3-4 weeks your goal is to find good sources, narrow down your topic, and discuss your options and thoughts with your adviser, to make sure that you have a solid topic and a solid set of good peer reviewed sources. 

Most peer reviewed sources in CS are indexed in ACM Digital library and/or in IEEE Xplore database. However, these databases may not be the best starting point for looking. Google scholar may be a better starting point.  

#### Google scholar vs CS databases

* CS databases list mostly peer reviewed sources (with some exceptions, such as invited talks and textbooks which are not peer reviewed). Google scholar lists everything that looks like scholarly work. Examples of non-reviewed work that comes up on Google scholar are technical reports, drafts that never got published, course work by students, etc.  
* Google scholar tends to give preference to more recent materials. This may be a good thing since you are looking for recent papers, but may also be problematic if you need background work on a subject.    
* Google scholar indexes papers in all areas of science, not just CS. Be careful with common search terms, they may mean something entirely different in another area of science (e.g. *mutation*). CS  databases list only CS-related papers (although IEEE also includes computer engineering).
