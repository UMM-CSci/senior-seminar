# UMM CSci senior seminar description and requirements

## Description.

This is the senior seminar (CSci 4901) description in the catalog: 

> In-depth survey of literature in a specific computer-related field of the student's choice. Students analyze various articles or similarly published works, synthesize their contents, and present their work formally in a conference setting. Multiple writing and speaking experiences reviewed by faculty and classmates.

This is both a great opportunity and a great challenge.

It will almost certainly be a lot of work for a one credit course and you should prepare accordingly, but it's totally manageable if you start early, stay organized and focused, and work on it incrementally.

A good senior sem experience, however, can really have far reaching consequences. KK's senior sem paper became (in slightly modified form) her first publication in computer science.
Another alum used her paper as the writing sample that sealed a deal with a publisher to write a book.
And numerous students have been quite pleasantly surprised with what they were in fact capable of.
One of the few really consistent themes we get from alumni and employers is the importance of communications skills, both written and oral, and this is a tremendous opportunity to develop these skills in really powerful ways.
